# sanpazu-cocos2dx
puzzle part of sanpazu game. written in cocos2d-x 3.2
my first mobile game written in C++ using cocos2d-x framework. 
Accidently deleted all resource files So, I copied resource files from from unity version. So it might occur that "resource not found" error because file name is different or path is different.
